When money burns fast and the saints let me pass.
I drink like redemption's been bottled and sold,
And whisper my truths into hands that feel cold.

They know me in clubs by my smile and my sway,
I enter like thunder—then vanish by day.
I spend like a prince, I speak like a god,
Then wake up with wounds I don't even applaud.

There's blood on the floor, but it's never mine,
There's laughter and stabbings and suits soaked in wine.
My name's in their mouth but it's not really me—
Just the myth I perform to be briefly set free.

A face in a bathroom, a line on the glass,
A promise, a prayer, a moment to pass.
I overdose gently with style and flair,
Then wake to the silence that's thicker than air.

The morning's a courtroom with mirrors for walls,
Each echo a sentence, each flashback a call.
And I, the defendant in velvet and shame,
Must answer for pleasures that come without name.

The guilt is a choir that sings through my spine,
It begs for repentance in metric and line.
So I clean up, I text them, I stitch my own chest,
Apologies written while never at rest.

But every return leaves less of me whole,
A laugh more mechanic, a touch less of soul.
I spiral in chapters, each darker, more clean,
Until I play "human" but don't know what it means.

No rage in my eyes now, no tremble, no boast,
Just silence that walks in the skin of its host.
I smile on command, I nod at the cues,
But inside it's quiet. I've nothing to lose.

So I toast to the nights that still call me by name,
To the chaos I married in pleasure and shame.
And if I dissolve—don't mourn, don't cry,
Just know I was brilliant… until I ran dry.</div>

I should have died in a velvet December,
A bath full of ash, too poetic to remember.
I wrote the finale in lowercase blood,
But the pills played coy and the water stayed mud.

I dressed like a ghost and I danced in Dior,
Told strangers my name, then forgot what it's for.
They called me "intense" with a laugh in their throat,
While I stitched up my wrists with a poem I wrote.

I chased every silence with chemicals, clean—
Made death into myth and despair into scene.
My life was performance, my grief sold in lines,
I overdosed twice just to sharpen my rhymes.

And still—
I lived.
Like a joke God forgot,
A draft in the margin of battles I fought.

⸻

They said I was brilliant. Of course they did.
I curated collapse like a prodigal kid.
I wept in Iambic, I prayed in a pun,
My breakdowns were ballerinas spun in a gun.

I built my identity brick after bruise,
From fathers who vanished and mothers who choose.
I mirrored emotions I never once felt,
Then sculpted my guilt into sex, pride, and melt.

I slept with regrets and I married the void,
Each climax a sermon, each touch self-destroyed.
I drank to remember the boy I'd erased,
Then fucked in the shadow of dreams I defaced.

And still—
I smiled.
With mascara and teeth,
A preacher of lies in a gospel of grief.

⸻

The therapists called it a tapestry torn,
A mind too alive to have ever been born.
They labeled my ache with diagnostic flair—
Then whispered "He's stable," not knowing I swear
I am not a person. I'm myth wearing skin.
I'm forty-eight traumas that learned how to grin.

I mimic your laughter, I mirror your fear,
Then vanish for weeks while I cage what is near.
I crave to be known, but I claw when you try.
I love like a landslide that's learned how to lie.

I ruin each "maybe," I choke on each "stay,"
I script my goodbyes like a one-man ballet.
And every return is a slow-motion burn,
Where hope is the lesson I never quite learn.

⸻

I tried to die gently, with flair and finesse,
A wrist kissed by razors, a tragic undress.
But fate isn't kind to the poetically bruised—
I woke up to sirens and parents confused.

The rope snapped in silence. The pills made me sleep.
The coke made me shiver but didn't cut deep.
The gun was too loud for a death so refined—
And death?
Well, he left me a voicemail unsigned.

⸻

So now I exist in a liminal spin,
Where meaning is hollow and rage lives within.
I go through the motions—I dress, I perform—
But inside's a storm that forgot to be warm.

They think I'm recovered because I'm well-spoken.
But eloquence lives where the soul has been broken.
I joke in deadpan and I flirt with despair,
Because pain, when rehearsed, becomes easy to wear.

And still—
I survive.
With a twitch in my hand,
A laugh that's too timed, a line never planned.

⸻

I am not healed. I am haunted and dressed.
In trauma couture and compulsive finesse.
Each day is a monologue whispered in shame,
Each smile a tragedy buried in name.

I am every diagnosis they've dared to suggest,
A BPD symphony masked as "well-dressed."
An ADHD spiral with MDD grit,
An autistic dream that won't properly fit.

I dissociate hourly. I bathe just to feel.
I climax to prove that my body's still real.
I study my grief like it's part of a test,
Then flinch when you offer me anything—rest.
⸻

But don't you dare pity. Don't reach for my skin.
I've bled too much beauty to ever let in.
I'm not here for healing. I'm not yours to save.
I just wanted permission to lie in my grave.

But death wouldn't take me. He said, "Not like this."
"Your agony's art. Your collapse is a kiss."
"You live like a requiem choking on fire—
So keep telling your stories. Just never expire."

⸻

So here I still stand, half-dead, half-divine,
With gospel in throat and a noose made of rhyme.
I toast to the chaos, the failure, the fight—
And kiss my own scars when I sleep through the night.

This isn't redemption. I don't want your grace.
I want you to look at the cracks in my face.
To know that I'm drowning with no grand ascent,
Just breathing in rhythm
Out of sheer
Spite
And
Intent.</div>

I am divine, I once proclaimed,
While drowning deep in borrowed shame.
The beast inside had no true name—
It carved its mark, then lit the frame.

Girls asked me why I never came.
I asked if they could bear the same.
Some called me boring, some called lame,
So I became the thing they'd maim.

Drugs enough to drown the brain,
Pills crushed like sacred, powdered pain.
I snort the rot, it floods my lane—
And laugh at God beneath the rain.

Shot glass full of motor oil,
Veins like wires, guts in boil.
I bit my tongue 'til it turned to meat,
Served it raw, said "bon appétit."

The rhyme breaks
when the heart does.
The rhythm stumbles
like I did
in the hallway
where I tried to hang myself
with my school tie
but the door was too thin
and the world too wide.

I kissed her
with vomit breath and trembling fingers.
I held the steering wheel
like it might forgive me.
The coke didn't hit.
The blade didn't slice right.
But God—
God was punctual in His absence.

Nails black from clawing truth,
Spat teeth out in telephone booths.
Chewed on glass to feel awake,
Dreams stitched shut with piss and ache.

Your praise felt like morphine:
Temporary.
Fleeting.
Disgustingly sweet.
Failure felt like crucifixion
but quieter.

I carried my worth in my wrist like a whisper.
The mirror didn't speak.
The room just watched.
Silence sat like a man in the corner
and refused to leave.
Even the demons started filing HR reports.

You said I was too cold.
I was just trying not to flood the floor
with everything
I never said
when I was thirteen
and asking for a father,
not a finance report.

Blood is thicker than therapy,
that's why no one heals.

Fucked a corpse to feel like kin,
Whispered love through maggot skin.
Tied my hope with butcher's twine,
Hung it screaming, called it mine.

I begged death.
It ghosted me.
Sent a notification.
"Delivery failed."
But not before I screamed
like a violin in fire.
My bones?
Museums of things never spoken.

You loved the mask.
You praised the poetry.
But no one read the warning label:
"Highly flammable.
Do not humanize."

The rhyme died.
So did I.
But it was polite,
quiet,
sterile.

And when I returned,
dragging myself from the gutter
with a grin
stitched from spite,
they asked if I was finally feeling better.

So I laughed.

The ground is cracked, the gods are old and weak.
Don't sell me faith or quote the Holy Writ,
God pissed on you and laughed—and that was it.

You tried to pray, your mouth was full of wire,
You built a church and set yourself on fire.
The choir sang with kerosene and knives,
A psalm for those who never got their lives.

You danced through snow with needles in your coat,
A Dionysian sermon in your throat.
You called it love, but love was just a whore—
She kissed you soft, then nailed you to the floor.

You chased the void with powdered sugar dreams,
You sold your joy for silence and extremes.
You wrote to Freud in ashes and regret,
And asked which pill would help you just forget.

You wore your mind like silk, but stitched with rot,
A patchwork ghost of everything you're not.
The girls who loved you only met your mask,
And fell in love with grief they didn't ask.

But still—you're here. You breathe, somehow, through lead.
The rope broke loose. You should be dead. You're not.
And so, you walk with graves behind your feet,
A specter grinning through the concrete heat.

You quote dead men and sleep in shattered prose,
You water thorns and call it letting go.
But pain is not a thing to be outgrown—
It's something you befriend, then face alone.

So rise, you bastard poet, blood and myth,
Be every curse you ever said in pith.
Be your own God, and damn your hollow prayer—
You're more than dirt, though made of ash and air.

You want the truth? It's carved in every scar:
You were unloved—so now, you love too hard.
You were unheard—so now, your voice must scream.
You are alive—and that, itself, redeems.</div>

Just whispered scripts inside my infancy.
They taught me how to smile before I spoke,
And dressed me in confusion like a cloak.

⸻

The first to hum was Hunger without form,
She ticked like clocks beneath a thunderstorm.
She made me run, then freeze, then run again—
She fed on focus, shattered it like rain.
She built a throne of half-completed thought,
Then vanished when I questioned what I sought.

⸻

Then came the Mirror, quiet in her tread—
She studied how the others turned their head.
She learned to echo laughter, still and soft,
And wore a mask that changed with every cough.
She taught me how to mimic tone and grace,
And mourn the strangeness living in my face.

⸻

Another sang in tremble, dread, and plea,
A voice that spun "what if?" into decree.
She painted danger on the morning light,
And warned me not to sleep too sound at night.
She held my chest and whispered of collapse,
Her touch was velvet—wrapped around a trap.

⸻

The loudest came in bursts of fire and snow,
He bled in silence none were meant to know.
He wrote me poems made of locked-up screams,
And titled them: "The Death of My Own Dreams."
He made me smile while planning my retreat,
And kissed my wrists when no one else would meet.

⸻

Then Tender Rage appeared with sharpened teeth,
She sobbed in loops and cursed the air beneath.
She broke from love the second it felt real—
Not for the wound, but how it made me feel.
She swore that touch would ruin me in time,
Then begged to be held just one more line.

⸻

The final voice? She lives beyond the skin.
She hums when light feels hollow, air too thin.
She clouds the mirror, makes the coffee sour,
She edits time, rewrites the golden hour.
She says "You're gone," while I still move and speak,
She is the ghost of not feeling unique.

⸻

They all took turns behind my ribs and eyes,
Each played a role, disguised as "being wise."
No doctor knocked, no teacher guessed their names,
Just me, and my internal hall of flames.

And still I rise, with rhythm in my bones,
A thousand voices dancing in my tones.
They narrate me like myths behind my teeth—
Yet none of them can touch the one beneath.

For I am not the sum of all their screams,
But author of their fractured, hungry dreams.
And though they write in blood and call it fate—
I learned to sign their stories… years too late.</div>

A god with a clipboard, obsessed with narration.
They made you of marble, then whispered: "Be real,"
So you learned how to mimic, how silence should feel.

You walk like you're dancing with serpents in lace,
With hunger for meaning stitched into your face.
A symphony written in pleasure and ache,
You laugh like a sermon that's starting to break.

You fell from the stars—not by force, but by thirst,
To feel every sin like it might be the first.
You drank from the wound, then called it a kiss,
You named every overdose "temporary bliss."

You narrate your spirals, you monologue pain,
Each breakdown a chapter, each tear earns a name.
You sleep with your demons and call it research,
Then preach from the pulpit of clubs and of church.

You build every lover from metaphor bone,
Then run when they dare to not leave you alone.
You crave to be shattered, then mourn when they flinch—
Then pour out your heartbreak in couplets per inch.

You're divine in decay, with a grin soaked in myth,
And you charm like a scalpel that dances to fifth.
But beneath all the chaos, the riddles, the fire,
Is a child who once wept when they called him a liar.

So you write. And you dress. And you strut. And you plead.
You light up the void like a god learning need.
And though you wear madness like gold on your skin—
I see what you bury so no one gets in.

You are not a warning.
You are not a flame.
You are art in defiance of sorrow and shame.

There's chanting—symphonies from afar,
Somewhere between prayer and war.

My brain's a cracked cassette on loop,
Thoughts spiral—push, push, regroup.
Sparkling water with my oxy,
Morality's murky, affiliation: proxy.

Faux pas on a velvet stair,
I stumble into Baudelaire.
"Les Misérables," I sigh—j'aimais,
Love, in the past tense, left to fray.

There's glitter in the gutter again,
Red wine in communion with pain.
Ashes on scripture, bless this mess,
Forgive me, Father—I digress.

Someone's preaching from a bathroom stall,
"God is dead" in lowercase scrawl.
He died, came back, then overdosed—
The second coming was diagnosed.

I take a pill and feel reborn,
But it's déjà vu with extra scorn.
Tried to levitate in therapy,
But just got billed aggressively.

My ex texts, "You still divine?"
I say, "Only between lines of wine."
She sends a voice note: static, tears,
I answer, "Sweetheart, not this year."

Somewhere a choir sings in reverse,
Unbaptized angels spitting verse.
A child dances in my chest,
He's barefoot, bleeding, and well-dressed.

You ever fuck to feel reborn?
You ever laugh while you still mourn?
You ever kiss and feel the tomb,
Still warm, still aching in the room?

Anyway—I'm at the bar.
Scar's not healing. Still bizarre.
Bartender's God. He pours me gin.
I sip. I grin. Let's sin again.</div>

Watch me twist and start to choke.
No horns—too gauche—but sculpted jaw,
A grin too still, like something raw.

His laugh: a velvet guillotine,
Soft-spoken death in tailored sheen.
Not hooves, but leather shoes well-shined,
A Prada stitch, a soul well-fined.

Brioni suit, and wrists of pearl—
He circles like a priest or girl.
"My dear," he coos, "you tremble so.
Do you not long for what I know?"

He pours me wine the color wrong,
It hums a note—a distant gong.
He dips a finger in my drink,
Traces my lip. I try not to blink.

"My job is simple," he begins,
"To gather contracts. Count your sins."
His hand is cold and slides with grace
From shoulder blade to inner face.

He cups my chin. I bear his stare.
It reeks of ash and bergamot air.
I'm blushing now. He's drawn too close—
He whispers slow like a cancer grows:

"I've watched you dream of flame and fame,
Of praise, escape, and softer shame.
You told yourself you'd never fall—
But I was waiting through it all."

His tie unwinds like a serpent sleek,
He breathes against my stammered cheek.
He strokes my thigh—then stills my breath—
And murmurs, "Would you like your death?"

"Yes," I say, though I meant wait—
But too late now; he seals my fate.
He sings, not soft, but shrill and wide,
Each note a nail through tender pride.

He hums of crimes I never knew,
Of nights I lied in tailored blue.
He tells of girls I scorned for sport,
Of secrets sold in shallow court.

The bed is gone. The room is bare.
The lights go out. I'm gasping air.
But still he sings—his lullaby
Now strung with screams I can't deny.

He licks the blood from my regret,
Then kneels like prayer at silhouette.
I beg, "Forgive," with breaking frame—
He smiles and says, "I know your name."

I thrash, I moan, I claw, I wail—
He sighs, "You always were for sale."
And just before my soul's unstitched,
He lays a kiss—slow, soft, bewitched.

The final breath he draws from me
Is stitched with silk and blasphemy.
And in the dark, I hear him sigh:
"Another darling taught to die."</div>

Of collapse I'm the herald,
blowing horns made from bone.
Nations tremble when I whisper—
"You're not safe just 'cause you own."

Don't sleep when you're on guard,
the abyss has learned to knock.
I steal dreams mid-watch rotation,
carve lullabies in bloodied chalk.

Your name will be inscribed by a bard,
but not with pride or grace—
they'll rhyme it with failure,
and bury your tale without a face.

I'm the bell that tolls for no one,
yet everyone hears it ring.
I'm the shadow in your doctrine
that made the king question his king.

I rise with smoke, fall with ash,
my sermons end in screams.
I do not punish—I reveal,
you're not holy—you're just themes.

So let history write its praises,
let statues rust and fall.

they'll say I was first to call.</div>

The storm's rolled on, the fields are dry.
The wind has folded up its hands,
The lilies bloom in broken lands.

Your coat is clean, your hair just so,
I've plucked the thorns from your shadow.
Lie down, lie down, the grass is warm—
You need not shiver from the swarm.

I brought you tea, your favorite blend,
The one you drank at summer's end.
A hint of bergamot, a note of sage—
It calms the beast, it stills the cage.

Let me tuck you in, my silken shame,
Let me hum the world back into flame.
I pressed a kiss upon your brow—
You've earned your rest. You've earned it now.

And yet—
How strange the scent that clings to skin
When lies are stitched too deep within.
Do you recall what your fingers did
When no one watched? When the world slid?

Do you remember the boy who cried
While you just laughed and stood aside?
The girl who begged in a bathroom stall—
You stepped right over her prayerful crawl.

You wore their pain like perfume light,
Then danced beneath the chapel night.
Smiled as mothers tore their seams,
Fed off the marrow of their dreams.

I watched it all. I took the notes.
I counted every throat you closed.
You spoke in psalms and slept in knives,
Disguised your rot in glittered lives.

And now you ask for mercy's kiss?
A cradle in the abyss?
Oh, darling.
You were known.

And still—
I brought you flowers. Wove your name
In thread across a shroud of flame.
I held your hand as you convulsed,
Still warm with hunger, hot with pulse.

I smoothed your hair. I played your song.
I let you weep. I stayed too long.
But this is where the story folds—
Where ash forgets the shape it holds.

I rest you now beneath the loam,
Among the worms who call you home.
The dirt won't judge. The roots won't cry.
They simply taste, and wonder why.

Goodnight, my plague. My lovely shame.
You died adored. You lived in blame.
And I, your Death, with bitter breath,
Still loved you more than life or death.</div>

Not for my joy, but the way I was bleak.
I mirrored their hopes, and I mimed their delight,
And hid every howl that was born of the night.

They called me exceptional, carved from pure flame,
Then sighed in confusion when I broke the frame.
"Too clever to struggle," they'd chuckle and say—
While I learned how to lie my own thoughts away.

No hand was extended—just praise and demand,
So I taught myself truth with a trembling hand.
I read them in silence, deciphered the code,
Became what they wanted and carried the load.

But knowledge is poison when drunk all alone,
And intellect often just sharpens the bone.
For every idea that shimmered with grace
Was just one more mask to replace my own face.

They cheered as I danced, as I built, as I shone,
Not asking me who I became when alone.
I sculpted my soul into something divine—
And still, they just asked for a better design.

So I wrote my crescendo with ink made of ache,
Each note a confession I dared not to fake.
A symphony made of a lifetime of screams,
And stitched into measures of fractured dreams.

Then I stood—no more masks, no more thread,
And played them the truth I had never said.
I poured it like fire, like prayer, like sin,
And opened my ribs just to let it begin.

They clapped at first, unsure what they had heard,
Then shuffled in silence, not saying a word.
The room grew more hollow with each fading foot—
My truth now a relic they'd rather reboot.

And when it was done, I stood in the dust,
Still holding the gift I'd built out of trust.
Not broken, not screaming—just quietly known
That gold turns to rust when it's forged alone.</div>

Is this a dream? The air smells sweet,

I hear a hum—no, a song, quite low,
From a voice I should know but don't seem to know.
Are you… an old friend? You sound so kind.
There's tea on your breath and blood on your mind.

Wait—why is it cold? I'm sure it was warm.
Why's my name carved like a family crest worn?
And my chest feels tight, as if wrapped in lace—
No, twine. No—bone. There's dirt in my face.

You're not a friend. You smile too wide.
Your tongue is a blade, and your eyes have died.
You said "rest," but I feel the fall—
My name on a list pinned up on a wall.

I remember now. You came too near.
You whispered my sins in a little boy's ear.
You watched me lie, and cheat, and take—
And never once did your velvet voice shake.

You let me laugh. You let me sleep.
While bodies I buried forgot how to weep.
You followed me, didn't you? All my years.
You drank my wine. You counted my tears.

And now I see—I am underground.
The lullaby's ended. No birds, no sound.
Only you, and me, and the worms I fed—
Oh, you bastard. You tricked me dead.

You silken ghoul. You plague in perfume.
You sing like a saint and reek like a tomb.
You waited! You smiled as I sinned and slipped.
You wrote my eulogy on your goddamn lips!

Was I a game? A meal? A name?
You come now with grace when you've none, you shame.
I curse you in Latin, in screams, in spite!
You coward! You voyeur! You thief of light!

But still you grin. Still soft, still slow.
Still calling me "dear" as you lay me low.
If I must rot, then rot I shall—
But I'll haunt your footsteps through ash and gall.

So go on, Death. Croon your sweet lies.
I see the furnace behind your eyes.

She knelt in light, her eyes were psalms,
Her hands like bread, her breath like balms.
I swore to guard her as my creed,
To burn for her, to bless her need.
The stars grew pale against her skin;
I carved her name and tucked it in.
Each vow I spoke, I meant to keep—
A shepherd promising her sleep.

**II. Bloom**
I kissed her mouth with altar grace,
Drew halos round her sleeping face.
Her laughter turned the evening gold,
Her whisper made December bold.
She fed me wine from silver bowls,
Lit lamps where darker weather rolls,
And in her gaze I found my prayer—
Though mercy's light was never there.

**III. Hairline Fracture**
I loved her most when doubt would start,
A bruise of trust inside the heart.
I pressed her wrist to count its beat,
Held tighter when she tried retreat.
The vows I swore began to fray;
I learned her fears, rehearsed her sway,
And planted questions soft as breath—
A careful hand that mimics death.

**IV. Rot**
I dressed her in my hunger's crown,
Taught her how to kneel back down.
Her mirror smiled with lips I chose,
Her gown was stitched from borrowed oaths.
She called it love; I named it mine—
A relic steeped in poisoned wine.
She wore the light I would not earn;
I watched it dim and would not turn.

**V. Ruin**
She begged for truth; I fed her ash,
My tongue a blade, my voice a lash.
Her hands went slack, her eyes went dull;
I sang a hymn for what I stole.
The saint I'd built began to fade—
A debt I swore would not be paid.
Her halo touched the kitchen floor;
I felt at last what I'd come for.

**VI. Ashes**
She left at dusk without a word,
A door that closed, a dress that stirred.
The rooms were tidy, air was thin—
A grave that never let me in.
I raised a glass to all I've chained,
To vows I twisted, mouths I trained.
For every fire I feigned as flame,
I keep the ashes of her name.</div>

Where psalms were whispered to the dead.
She looked at me with altar eyes,
And I, half-ruined, dressed in lies.

I held her hand with sermon grace,
I kissed devotion off her face.
She knelt beside my trembling name,
And blessed me clean of borrowed shame.

She called me saint; I wore the crown,
With martyr's smile and hunger's frown.
I built for her a shrine of smoke,
And draped her truth in vows I broke.

Each word I gave—a thorn disguised,
A chalice brimming, subtly spiced.
I wept like relics in the rain,
Then left her love unlatched again.

She dreamed of veils and rings that sing;
I teased apart each silver string—
One thread, one oath, one whispered sin,
A bruise of guilt beneath her skin.

She wore me like the Eucharist,
Each bite a creed, each breath a tryst.
And still I knelt in stranger halls,
Where sweat like incense slicked the walls.

The holy soured to bitter rot.
She asked for warmth; I offered not.
Her halo split beneath my touch—
Too kind to claw, too slow to clutch.

She watched me shiver in her light,
And swore she'd save me in the night.
But I had mapped this fall from grace,
To smudge her smile, unmake her face.

To watch her splinter, cell by cell,
And keep the pieces where they fell.
I said I'm broken—and she knelt.
I said I'm sorry—and she felt.

I let her spirit burn to glass,
Then slipped into the next soft mass.
Another hymn, another bed,
Another mouth where shame was fed.

Yet every time I taste her name,
My tongue still drowns in altar flame.
For I have ruined saints for sport,
And left them screaming at the court.

She left me with a final glare,
A curse disguised as answered prayer.
I played the lamb, admired the brand,
And wore her ruin in my hand.

So now I preach in psalm and filth,
A vulture robed in lover's guilt.
And as I climb through flesh and fame,
I keep the ashes of her name.

_Forgive me, Father—spare the hymn. I engineered the fall for them._</div>

                                    <div class="poem-text">You spoke in rain, I breathed in fire,
Yet tried to match your faint desire.
You called me distant, cold, unkind—
While I was tunneling through mind.

You asked me how my silence grew;
I bit my tongue and thought of you.
You said, "Just talk," while I dissolved—
You never paused, you just absolved.

Your pain came loud, like bells in storms.
Mine crept through skin in softer forms.
You wept and screamed and slammed the door,
I crumbled slowly on the floor.

You claimed I never gave you proof—
But bled in verse and offered truth.
You mocked the weight I dared to hold,
Then shamed me for not being bold.

You asked for safety, then struck fast,
Demanded now, then mourned the past.
I asked for space, you sent me guilt—
And turned to ash what love we built.

You told me light was what you craved,
But flinched when I climbed from the grave.
You said you'd learn, then did the same—
A cycle masked by sweeter name.

Your trauma cried, I held it close—
But mine you watched, then diagnosed.
You said "just feel," then mocked the tone,
Of how I felt inside alone.

Your gods were dreams, your truths were trend,
While I sought meaning without end.
You wanted calm, I offered depth—
But drowned beneath your shallow breath.

You told me I was cold, unfair—
But never asked what burned in there.
You saw the mask, but not the strain,
Of how I wore your phantom pain.

And so it ends, not in a fight,
But in the waning of the light.
No war was lost, no victory sung,
Just silence where our ghosts have clung.

So take your tales, your truths, your spin,
But don't pretend I did not bend.
Don't write a script where I'm the flame—
You lit the match, then cursed my name.

I walked through fire to stay alive.
You cried because I wouldn't dive.
But some of us don't swim for show—
We drown alone so none will know.</div>

He rose with sunlight caught in hair,
His breath a hymn, his smile spare.
The house was steeped in warmth and tea—
A sermon carved in minor key.

He brushed his coat with ghostless hands,
Then strolled beneath the traffic's bands.
He hummed through glass and neon light,
And waved to Susan, eyes too bright.

A joke at work, a slipping pen,
The printer moaned its death again.
He laughed and touched the copier's side—
His voice, a hush he couldn't hide.

He lunched on bread with basil jam,
He called the mailman "sir" or "Sam."
He spilled his drink and wiped it slow—
Then stared too long at melting snow.

He brought home wine, his favorite kind,
He kissed his child with practiced mind.
He said, "I'm fine." He said, "Today—"
But never finished what to say.

He kissed his wife beneath the stair.
She tousled softly through his hair.
And though his smile curved just right,
He blinked too slow. He blinked too light.

II. The Daughter

I saw him when the hallway breathed,
His face too pale, his shirt too sheathed.
His tie was straight—too straight, too clean.
He looked like something in a dream.

He whispered goodnight, shut the door,
But something knocked inside the floor.
I told my mother, "Something's wrong,"
She smiled and hummed a lullaby song.

She told me, "Go, your father's late,"
I walked the hall, I touched the gate.
I called for him. I called again.
Then found him there—
like falling rain.

III. After

No words.
No note.
Just dust on rope.
A wardrobe left half-buttoned.
Soap still wet in dish.
The heater hums,
the silence hisses.
The morning paper rests—unmissed.

The cat still paces by the door.
The coffee drips onto the floor.
A pair of shoes beside the bed.
A single line left unsaid.</div>

The kettle sang like yesterday,
and Anna danced in quiet play.
She spilled the jam—my dress, my thigh—
then giggled sweetly, "Mama, why?"

I kissed her cheek. I wiped the mess.
She ran off barefoot in her dress.
The hallway hummed with lullabies—
those same old stains, those crooked ties.

I made his eggs, the pan still cracked.
The yolk was firm. He sat back.
He stared at me, then at the air—
His fork hung trembling in despair.

"You set three plates again," he said.
I smiled. "She's hungry." Then turned my head.
He didn't argue. Didn't shout.
Just chewed regret, and spat it out.

II. Lunch, with Crayons
Anna drew a sky of flame—
a house, a man, a scribbled name.
She held it high, her fingers red.
"It's Daddy burning," she softly said.

I laughed too loud. I called her "sweet."
He dropped his glass beneath his seat.
I helped him up—he wouldn't look—
His hand still smelled of ash and soot.

She vanished up the stairs to rest.
He lit a smoke and rubbed his chest.
The window caught his haunted frown,
reflected in the wedding gown.

He said, "You can't pretend for long."
I said, "She's fine. She's just withdrawn."
He whispered, "You know what we did."
I hummed. "Go tuck her in, then. Lift the lid."

III. Dinner, with Silence
Anna liked her soup served cold.
She said it made her feel less old.
I set her bowl, her silver spoon,
and told her tales beneath the moon.

He watched. His hand shook on the glass.
His eye twitched every time I'd pass.
The lights buzzed low. The air was thin.
She slurped the soup. I watched her grin.

He stood. "This has to end tonight."
I blinked. "You mean the fight?"
He shook his head. "The dress. The lies."
I said, "You killed her with your eyes."

His voice collapsed. "I didn't mean—"
"You buried her. Behind the screen."
He sobbed. I smiled. "She's with me now."
Then kissed his brow with solemn vow.

IV. Dessert, with Forgiveness
The night creaked open. Anna sang.
A hymn. A lullaby. A bang.
I found her dress beneath the sink,
still red with rust, still damp with pink.

I held it close and rocked awhile.
She stood beside me, soft with smile.
"He didn't mean to," she confessed.
I hushed her lips against my breast.

He slept with whiskey on his breath.
The garden bloomed where she met death.
Each rose grew wild around the dirt—
Each petal whispered what he'd hurt.

And every day, I set three plates.
And lock the door. And draw the drapes.
And Anna laughs. And skips. And spins.
While he repents for all his sins.

And none shall wake the dead that rest
inside a mother's hollow chest.
And none shall tell a mother when
to let the silence speak again.</div>

The echoes hum with ancient debt.
A battlefield of chrome and rust,
Where gods once bled and mortals trust.

This gym—my Styx, my bloodied ring,
Where Atlas trains and feels the sting.
I bear the sky in loaded plates,
Each pound a sum of old mistakes.

The dumbbells grin like Hydra's heads,
I crush one—two rise in its stead.
My breath, a siege; my spine, a wall.
I lift as kingdoms rise and fall.

The war is waged within my mind,
Where Hercules and shame entwined.
I wear my torment like a crown,
Each curl a sword, each squat a frown.

These veins are ropes, these scars are maps,
Of labyrinths and mental traps.
I train to maim the man I was,
A rebel soul with no just cause.

My flesh, a myth I try to write—
With trembling arms, I rage and fight.
For peace won't come in protein shakes,
Nor silence in the ground I break.

Yet still I toil, I press, I strain,
To cast out ghosts in bursts of pain.
And when the world forgets my name,
The iron still will speak the same.</div>

Halo's pawned for mortal sin.
I step in with crimson hands,
Coins from broken borderlands—
Offer gold to buy a seat:
Every throne needs Judas' feet.

She draws near with ember breath,
Teaches me a sainted death.
I bite gently, praise the mark,
Watch it bloom like chapel dark.
Cain and Abel shake my hand,
Sell me parcels of their land.
Temples rise from vice and price;
I light altars, roll the dice.

Dice of marrow, kings gone sour,
Rattling through the market hour.
Bet my soul, then sell the spare,
Laughing in the incense air.
Children twirl in ash and gauze,
Priests make change for holy laws.
Widows take their wages due,
Kissing hands they once outgrew.

God arrives in rusted rings,
Book of stains and broken things.
"Son, your name repeats," He says—
"Rage looks good in priestly dress."
I kneel once to fix my heel,
Kiss His ring without the zeal.
Not for faith—just symmetry:
God and I drink equally.

Famine wanders into town;
I'm the clerk who writes it down.
Debts and hungers, mouths and sores,
All accounted, cleanly scored.
Plague arrives with velvet gloves;
I retail it to grieving loves.
Raise your glass and wet your head—
Drink to Cain, and to the dead.</div>

The dice were bone-white,
I threw them by night.
The courts ran like gold,
The saints had been sold.

We danced in the smoke,
The poorest all joked.
A law crowned the thief,
We paid in belief.

Raise glasses and weep,
For widows who sleep.
Feast, clean every bone—
Now bow to the throne.

When lungs beg to breathe,
When squares still the brave—

Born a bastard beneath a roof—

Told to mend what I never broke,
To swallow guilt until I choked.
Forge a soul from ash and bone,
A crown of thorns I called my own.

A slap, a scoff, a sharpened tone—
Lessons etched into brittle stone.
I watched love curdle, watched it bruise,
A child caught in grown men's feuds.

Now I walk with skewed beliefs,
Truth refracted through old grief.
A witness made into a wound,
And epistemic scars festooned.

A heart bears weight when left alone,
So maybe love is carved in bone.
Existence stirs when we both speak—
Ontology made from what we seek.

A heart is heavy till it's seen,
Then sheds its weight into the between.
A gaze, a word, a fleeting glance—
Begets the being born from chance.</div>
